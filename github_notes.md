# GitHub Notes

To check your own understanding of GitHub, answer the questions that follow.

1. **What is the purpose of GitHub?** To track and save changes to a project / repository remotely, and to potentially collaborate with teammates or others on files outside of my own local machine.

1. **What is the difference between forking and cloning a repository?** Forking creates a copy of the repository remotely, in my own personal GitHub account. Cloning an existing repository creates a copy on my local machine so I may make changes locally to the files, and possibly push them to my copy of the original repository.
